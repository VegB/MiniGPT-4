Materials. Compare properties of objects. An object has different properties. A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Properties can also tell you how an object will behave when something happens to it. Different objects can have properties in common. You can use these properties to put objects into groups. Grouping objects by their properties is called classification. Look at each object. For each object, decide if it has that property. An opaque object does not let light through. All three objects are opaque. A slippery object is hard to hold onto or stand on. The tortoise shell and the basketball are not slippery. A shiny object reflects a lot of light. You can usually see your reflection in a shiny object. The crown is shiny, but the basketball is not. The property that all three objects have in common is opaque."

Classification. Describe, classify, and compare kingdoms. In the past, scientists classified living organisms into two groups: plants and animals. Over the past 300 years, scientists have discovered many more types of organisms. Today, many scientists classify organisms into six broad groups, called kingdoms. Organisms in each kingdom have specific traits. The table below shows some traits used to describe each kingdom. | Bacteria | Archaea | Protists | Fungi | Animals | Plants How many cells do they have? | one | one | one or many | one or many | many | many Do their cells have a nucleus? | no | no | yes | yes | yes | yes Can their cells make food? | some species can | some species can | some species can | no | no | yes.

Persuasive strategies. Identify appeals to ethos, pathos, and logos in advertisements. The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals. Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following: say that a brand has been trusted for many years include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association feature a testimonial from a 'real person' who shares the audience's values use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following: use graphs or charts to display information cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies explain the science behind a product or service emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice anticipate and refute potential counterclaims Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following: trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury. The ad appeals to pathos, or emotion, by evoking feelings of parental love and concern."

Solutions. Compare concentrations of solutions. A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent. The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent. In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter. Solution A and Solution B have the same number of green particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same."

Force and motion. How do balanced and unbalanced forces affect motion?. A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Each force acts on an object in a certain direction. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, they are called opposing forces.Find the direction Rusty pulls on the toy. Two dogs, Rusty and Coco, play with a toy. Think about two of the forces that act on the toy: Coco pulls toward herself. Rusty pulls away from Coco. The text tells you that Rusty pulls away from Coco. The opposite direction is toward Coco. So, the direction of the opposing force is toward Coco."

Ecological interactions. Classify symbiotic relationships. When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected. This table lists three common types of symbiotic relationships. It shows how each organism is affected in each type of symbiotic relationship. Type of symbiotic relationship | Organism of one species... | Organism of the other species... Commensal | benefits | is not significantly affected Mutualistic | benefits | benefits Parasitic | benefits | is harmed (but not usually killed). When a rat tapeworm attaches itself to a rat's intestine, the tapeworm gets nutrients that it needs to grow and survive. So, the tapeworm benefits from its relationship with the rat. The rat loses nutrients from its food to the tapeworm. So, the rat is harmed by its relationship with the tapeworm. Since the tapeworm benefits and the rat is harmed, a parasitic relationship is formed when a rat tapeworm attaches itself to the intestine of a rat."

Rocks and minerals. Identify rocks and minerals. Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals. Minerals and rocks have the following properties: Property | Mineral | Rock It is a solid. | Yes | Yes It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes It is a pure substance. | Yes | No It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither. Look closely at the last three properties: Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms. Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks. Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks. A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not. A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures. A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not. The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way. However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! The properties of dolerite match the properties of a rock. So, dolerite is a rock."
